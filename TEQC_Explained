Introduction: teqc




Interpreting teqc’s qc Mode Output

Section 21.
The quality check output from teqc is in two portions, the short report segment and the long report segment. The short report segment include
an ASCII time plot and a summary report on various parameters. The long report segment gives a more detailed breakdown on some of these
parameters either by SV or by elevation (if qc full).
Short Report Segment:
In the short report segment, one of the most compact pieces of information from a qc output is the ASCII time plot. In this plot, a visual
summary of various types of quality indicators are displayed for each satellite as a function of time. The SV PRN number is displayed on both
the left and right side of the plot. The width of the ASCII time plot is controlled by the -w[idth] option, and is normally set to 72, though it
can vary from 1 to 255; with a width of 72 and 24-hours worth of observation data, each ASCII character "bin" represents exactly 20 minutes
of time. Each character shown in each spot in the ASCII time plot is the most significant item of note that took place for all of the observation
epochs represented by that bin, according to a well-defined symbol hierarchy.
A listing of the entire ASCII plot symbol table can be dumped to stdout by executing:
teqc ++sym
Likewise, a summary of the symbol hierarchy table can be included in the short report segment by including a +sym option with any qc-mode
run. But in this tutorial, let’s take a closer look at the symbols and their hierarchy. The symbols used on each "SV" line are as follows, with
the first symbol having the highest priority in the symbol hierarchy, decreasing through the list:
C
a clock slip occurred; a clock slip is an MP1 and MP2 slip that occurred for all satellites being observed (tracked) and had a value
that was the same integral number of milliseconds to a resolution specified by -msec_tol in milliseconds; detection is turned off
with -cl option
m
similar to a clock slip, but only some (i.e. not all) satellites being observed (tracked) had an MP1 or MP2 slip that was an integral
number of milliseconds, or the integral number was different for the different satellites; note: if the millisecond slip tolerance is
1e-2 (see -msec_tol), then there is roughly a 2:100 chance that a random MP1 or MP2 multipath slip will be tagged as an m,
rather than M, 1, or 2 (see elsewhere in this table)

I
ionospheric (phase) slip occurred; detection is turned off with -ion option
M
both MP1 and MP2 (code) slip occurred, but was not integral number of milliseconds; detection is turned off with -mp option
1
only MP1 (code) slip occurred, but was not integral number of milliseconds; detection is turned off with -mp option
2
only MP2 (code) slip occurred, but was not integral number of milliseconds; detection is turned off with -mp option
-
for qc full, satellite was above elevation mask, but no data was apparently recorded by the receiver; for qc-lite (no ephemeris
information), the data gap must also be less than the maximum specified (see argument of -gap_mx in minutes)
+
(qc full only) satellite was below elevation mask and a complete set of phase and code data was collected
^
(qc full only) satellite was below elevation mask and a partial set of phase and code data was collected
.
phase and/or code data for SV is L1 and C/A only & A/S is off; if qc full, satellite was above elevation mask
:
phase and/or code data for SV is L1 and P1 only & A/S is off; if qc full, satellite was above elevation mask
~
phase and/or code data for SV is L1, C/A, L2, P2 & A/S is off; if qc full, satellite was above elevation mask
*
phase and/or code data for SV is L1, P1, L2, P2 & A/S is off; if qc full, satellite was above elevation mask

y
phase and/or code data for SV is L1, P1, L2, P2 & A/S is on; if qc full, satellite was above elevation mask
L
Loss of Lock indicator was set by receiver for L1 and/or L2; detection is turned off with -lli option
_
(underscore) (qc full only) satellite between horizon and elevation mask with no data collected by receiver; indicator is turned off
with -hor option
‘ ’
(blank) qc lite: no satellite tracked; qc full: no satellite calculated to be above horizon (+hor option) or above mask (+hor option
or both -hor and +mask options) (see also -set_hor and -set_mask options)
Let’s examine a simple example. Suppose that the horizon is set at 0 degrees and the elevation mask is set at 20 degrees. Let’s also suppose
that the receiver starts tracking a particular satellite when it reaches 25 degrees of elevation and continues to track the satellite down to 5
degrees of elevation. Let’s also assume that no slips occurred during tracking and that the +hor option is set. For qc full (SV ephemeris
available), the SV symbol track might then look something like one of the following:
A/S on: _____--oooooooooooooooooo+++++__
A/S off: _____--******************+++++__
 1 2 3 4 5 6
At time (1), the SV rises above the horizon (0 degrees). At time (2), the SV rises above the elevation mask (20 degrees), but the receiver
doesn’t start tracking until is rises to 25 degrees at time (3). Between times (3) and (4) all phase and code observables are collected by the
receiver (L1, L2, C/A, and P2 for A/S on; L1, L2, P1, and P2 for A/S off). Data continued to be collected as the SV dropped below the
elevation mask at time (4) until the receiver stopped tracking at an elevation of 5 degrees at time (5). The SV finally sets below the horizon at
time (6). For qc lite, the above SV symbol track would appear as:
A/S on: ooooooooooooooooooooooo
A/S off: ***********************
 1 2 3 4 5 6
as teqc as no information about the elevation of the satellite.
If the -hor option is set, the above qc full SV symbol tracks would then appear as:
A/S on: --oooooooooooooooooo+++++
A/S off: --******************+++++
 1 2 3 4 5 6
so that you can determine everything you could with +hor set, except for the rise and set times of the SV at times (1) and (2), respectively.
For qc lite, the SV symbol tracks would remain the same as before, since the options -hor and +hor are meaningless.
Any additional symbols that occur in an SV symbol track not in the above examples fall into a "not so good" category, though seeing a lot of -
symbols in a qc full output is also "not good". Let’s take a look in more detail at what these other indicators might be.
The first "not so good" category could generally be considered "missing data". As mentioned above, the worst missing data indicator (qc full
only) is the -, which means that the SV was calculated using the supplied ephemeris to be above the elevation mask, but no observation data
was present for this SV. In other words, all data is missing.
Following the - "all data missing" indicator are the partial missing data indicators. For example, if A/S is normally on, seeing ; or , indicates
that there was at least one observation epoch in that bin where L2 observables (i.e. L2 and P2) were missing. You are unlikely to see a y, as
this would require a Y-code receiver (capable of tracking P1 while A/S is on). (An exception to this is when qc-ing data from an Ashtech
receiver like the Z-12. The C/A and P1 pseudorange observables are reported for all SVs, regardless of whether A/S is on or off.) If A/S is
normally off, seeing : or . indicates that there was at least one observation epoch in that bin where the L2 observables were missing. A ~
indicates that, for some reason, the receiver could not track P1, even though A/S was off, so the receiver instead recorded the C/A observable.
If you are using a P-code (not a Y-code) receiver that reports C/A and P1 pseudoranges for each SV at each epoch (like the Ashtech Z-12),
you may want to use the -Y option, which informs teqc that this is data not from a Y-code receiver, and to treat the qc analysis as though from
a P-code receiver.
Special Treatment of Data from Codeless Receivers
You may have a data set that was collected with a "codeless" or "squaring" receiver. For these receivers, the pseudoranges P1 and P2 are
never recorded, and the default qc report will show that all observations were incomplete, as none of them can have a P2 observation (though
C/A is acceptable in place of the missing P1). Also, the SV symbol tracks for the examples above would then appear as:
A/S on: _____--,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,+++++__
A/S off: _____--..................+++++__
 1 2 3 4 5 6
which (correctly) indicates a lack of L2 and P2, even though the observable P2 is not possible (and thus never present) and L2 may be always
present. 
You can inform teqc that the data is to be interpreted as though it were collected by a codeless receiver by including a -P option (and, of
course, the default option in +P). In this case, the absence of P-codes is ignored for statistics and the data indicators change collapse to just
two possibilities (from the original eight possibilities):
.
phase and/or code data for SV is L1, C/A; if qc full, satellite was above elevation mask
o
phase and/or code data for SV is L1, C/A, and L2; if qc full, satellite was above elevation mask
Notice that the A/S state (on or off) is ignored, as this is irrelevant for processing squared data. Then, when using the -P option, the above SV
symbol tracks will appear as:
A/S on: _____--oooooooooooooooooo+++++__
A/S off: _____--oooooooooooooooooo+++++__
 1 2 3 4 5 6
i.e., there is no difference whether A/S is on or off. You will probably see an occasional . data indicator:
A/S any: _____--ooo.ooooooo.oooooo+++++__
 1 2 3 4 5 6
indicating one or more observation epochs where the observable L2 is missing.
A listing of the entire ASCII plot symbol table modified for codeless receivers can be dumped to stdout by executing:
teqc -P ++sym
Other Indicators
The next set of "not so good" indicators are for slips in the observables. A common type of slip is an ionospheric (phase) slip indicated by a I
symbol. These often occur when the SV is at low elevation, both while rising and setting, so the example SV symbol tracks from above might
really appear as: 
A/S on: _____--Iooooooooooooooooo++I+I__
A/S off: _____--I*****************++I+I__
 1 2 3 4 5 6
In this example, ionospheric slips are detected shortly after the receiver starts tracking the SV and as the SV is close to setting.
The other common type of slip is for one or both of the multipath (code) observables, MP1 and MP2. Again, these frequently occur at low
elevations. There are three symbols: M for slip on both MP1 and MP2, 1 for slip on MP1 only, and 2 for slip on MP2 only. Notice that the
multipath slip indicators take a lower priority in the symbol hierarchy, so if an ionospheric slip and multipath slip occur at different
observations epochs within the ASCII bin, only the I symbol will be seen (assuming that the option configuration is +ion and +mp). If you
use -ion to suppress ionospheric slip detection, the above SV symbol tracks might now appear as:
A/S on: _____--Mooooooooooooooooo++2+M__
A/S off: _____--M*****************++2+M__
 1 2 3 4 5 6
Interestingly, the occurrence of ionospheric or multipath slips in the recorded observations is not only a function of the antenna environment
(meaning all the way back to the transmitting SV), but is also a function of the specific receiver. Due to internal slip detection and phase
observables resets, data from some receivers show virtually no ionospheric slips and nearly all multipath slips. Other receivers do not reset the
phase observables, and show a larger number of ionospheric slips than multipath slips.
The last type of slip is the "n-millisecond clock slip", where the value of n is usually 1, denoted by the symbol C in the SV symbol track. This
slip is reported if all SVs being tracked have slips in MP1 and MP2 equivalent to the same number of integral milliseconds, to a tolerance
specified by the -msec_tol option. If you set the tolerance to 1e-17 (milliseconds), you probably will never see any of these slips. However,
the default tolerance is 1e-2 (milliseconds), and with this value the qc mode of teqc seems pretty capable of detecting these slips if they are
present.
What does it mean if you see the C symbol in an SV symbol track? There are several causes, some more harmless than others. If the C
symbol is preceded by an observation gap (no data collected for any SVs), there may be one or more millisecond clock resets missing from
the observation epoch time tags. Also, if you use teqc to splice two RINEX OBS files together and clock resets occur in the first file, a C will
occur at the first epoch of the second file (since the teqc splice does not modify the observation times in the second file to account for the
accumulative clock resets in the first file). In other cases, however, if the observation epochs are fairly continuous, and the
C indicator is
appearing two or more times in 24-hours of data, there is a strong possibility that the receiver was not healthy.
This latter possibility (that the receiver was not healthy) prompted the inclusion of another slip indicator, the "n-millisecond multipath slip". It
was observed that some receivers get so unhealthy that, even though n-millisecond clock slips should be occurring (i.e., given the specific
receiver, no millisecond clock resets are present, even though they were expected) none were being found because the multipath slips for
different SVs had different millisecond equivalents. In short, the value for n was not a constant for all SVs being tracked. In this case, the
m
symbol is used. There is some probability (roughly about 2 : inverse of millisecond tolerance) that a random multipath slip will be recorded as
an
m instead of as a
M or 1 or
2; so, treat the occasional
m as you would any multipath slip. However, if you start to see lots of
m symbols,
especially if you have seen
C symbols being reported in the data from the same receiver, suspect that the receiver is ailing.
The next "not so good" category is presence of data gaps. There are really two types of gaps. One is a complete observation gap for all SVs.
This can be caused perhaps by the receiver being turned off and later turned back on, by a loss of all data for a period of time either internal to
the receiver itself or due to a communication breakdown with the receiver. Currently, a complete observation gap is not indicated in the SV
symbol tracks, except (on occasion) if they are present in a qc lite run.
The other type of gap is the SV data gap, where the receiver stops tracking an SV for a period of time even though it is well above the horizon
or elevation mask, perhaps due to an obstruction. The exact definition of an SV data gap depends on whether teqc is running in a qc full or qc
lite mode. For qc full, an SV data gap occurs if there are one or more missing observation epochs while the SV is above the elevation mask.
For qc lite, an SV data gap occurs if tracking stops for more than the specified minimum time (-gap_mn, again) and then tracking resumes
before a specified maximum time (see -gap_mx option). The symbol used in the SV symbol track is now -, so an SV data gap might look
like:
A/S on: _____--Ioooooooooo--ooooo++I+I__
A/S off: _____--I**********--*****++I+I__
 1 2 3 ab 4 5 6
which occurred at the interval (ab). The meaning is really the same as the interval (23), i.e. the SV was above the elevation mask, but no data
was received.
The only other indicator for SV data, low in the symbol hierarchy, is the "Loss of Lock" indicator,
L, which is used when the receiver issues a
loss of lock for either the L1 or the L2 observable. A large number of
L symbols may indicate an unhealthy receiver or antenna. This should
rarely, if ever, be seen in the ASCII time plot. 
Following the SV symbol tracks are one or four more, depending on whether you are using qc lite or qc full, respectively. For qc lite, there is
a symbol line labeled "Obs". This records the maximum number of SVs that were tracked by the receiver for each bin using a hexidecimal
representation. For example, if there is a
7 on this line, then 7 SVs were tracked for at least one observation epoch represented by that time
bin; if there is a
b on this line, then 11 SVs were tracked for a least one observation epoch represented by that time bin; and so on. If no SVs
were tracked, a (blank), rather than
0, is shown. If one or more s are present on the "Obs" line in a qc lite run, this is your best indicator that a
complete observation gap has occurred.
For qc full runs, the "Obs" line is replaced by four lines, labeled "-dn", "+dn", "+XX", and "Pos". The "+XX" line is the one most like the qc
lite "Obs" line; the XX is replaced by the elevation mask in degrees (rounded to the nearest degree) and indicates the maximum expected
number of SVs that are above the elevation mask, according to the supplied ephemerides, again using a hexidecimal notation. The difference
between the qc lite "Obs" line and the qc full "+XX" line is the difference between reality and theory: "Obs" shows what was seen, where
"+XX" shows what could have been seen (above the elevation mask).
The discrepancy between reality and theory is recorded in the "-dn" and "+dn" lines, which are the SV tracking discrepancy counts, and
record the two bounds of the discrepancy. They can be thought of as the "good new/bad news" to the number of SVs not tracked. The line
"-dn" records the minimum discrepancy of all observation epochs for that time bin while the line "+dn" records the maximum discrepancy of
all observation epochs for that time bin. The discrepancy count is also shown in hexidecimal notation, with (blank) for 0.
For the discrepancy lines to work correctly, the option -max_SVs must be set correctly. This states the maximum number of SVs that are
capable of being tracked by the receiver, and currently has a default value of 12. If a complete observation gap occurs with qc full, a group of
c characters will be shown (c is hex for 12), at least on the "+dn" line, and if the gap is large enough, on the "-dn" line as well.
The "Pos" line records the success or non-success of calculated code positions for the antenna at the different epochs. Generally, you should
see an
o recorded for each bin in which a position calculation was successful.
The last symbol line in the ASCII time plot is labeled "Clk". In the original UNAVCO QC, this line (labeled "CLK") represented all
millisecond receiver clock resets present in the observation epochs with a
C symbol. This has been replaced with either a
+ or - symbol,
meaning either a positive or negative millisecond receiver clock reset was detected, respectively. Another symbol which may be placed on
this line is
^, which is lower in the clock symbol hierarchy that either
+ or -, and indicates at least one missed observation epoch in that time
bin, though a correct value of the observation sampling interval must be set (see -O.int option) for this to work correctly. This symbol was
added to help reveal two things: 1) the existence of "micro-gaps", i.e. missing data periods less than that set by the -gap_mn option, and 2) to
identify short gaps during which a millisecond clock reset may have occurred. For example, if a portion of the "Clk" symbol track is:
Clk: + + + ^^ + + + ^+ + + + +
 12 3
then you can suspect a missing (positive) millisecond receiver clock reset at time (1) due to the regularity of the rest of the identified resets
and the missing epoch indicator ^, and other missing observation epochs at times (2) and (3). Other micro-gaps might exist in the data, but
their presence would be hidden by the + symbols.
Incidentally, another "micro-gap" indicator exists for qc full runs on the "+dn" line. Since this is maximum discrepancy between the number
of SVs that could have been observed and what were actually observed. However, for missing observation epochs (no SVs observed), rather
than placing a count of just "SVs that could have been observed" based on the ephemerides, teqc places a count of the maximum allowed by
the receiver. So, for a receiver capable of tracking 12 SVs (see -max_SVs option), you will also see a c (hex for 12) on this line when missing
a observation epoch.
Following the "Clk" line of the ASCII time plot is a scale bar with tick marks. The separation between tick marks is indicated a few lines
lower at "Time line window length". The tick marks should occur at even values of the tick interval. For example, if the time window starts at
01:39:30.000 (1h 39m 30s) and the tick interval is 3 hours, the tick marks will be placed at 03:00:00, 06:00:00, 09:00:00, and so on, to the
best resolution possible on the ASCII plot. The tic interval is self-scaling, from 0.1 seconds to 7 days, depending on the length of the time
window.
At the end of the ASCII time plot, the beginning and end time and date follow at the ends of scale bar. Seconds are only printed out if they are
non-zero.
Following the ASCII time plot in the short report segment is a report summary. First is a listing of the name of target files, and if qc-full, the
RINEX NAV files used.
The bounds of the time window is then shown. If the times of the first and/or last observation epochs do not match the bounds of the time
window, these epoch times are shown as well.
If the configuration environment variable or any configuration files were used, these are listed next.
If the observation interval is non-zero, this is given.
The total number of satellites (SVs) with any type of observations is then given. This is followed by a list of missing SVs, up to the maximum
set by default (probably 32), or using the -PRNs option, for each satellite system that had any members. Finally, if doing qc-full, a list of SVs
that did not have ephemeris information is given. 
The number of SVs which can be simultaneously tracked by the receiver is then given. This currently has a default value of 12, or can be
changed using the -max_SVs option.
If the observation interval is non-zero, the total number of possible observation epochs in the time window is given. This is followed the
number of epochs that actually had "complete observations" from at least one SV.
The definition of a "complete observation" is important, so it will be defined in detail here. In order for an observation from a GPS SV to be
"complete", it must have :
1. P1 or C/A code data
2. P2 code data
3. L1 and L2 code data
4. S/N for both L1 and L2 be at or above specified minima
5. if qc-full, an SV elevation at or above the elevation mask
Then the numbers of possible, complete, and deleted observations are given. If doing qc-full, the both the number of possible observations
above the horizon and above the elevation mask are given first. Next, the number of complete observations is given; if qc-full, this is
restricted to those observations above the elevation mask. Next, the number of deleted observations is given; if qc-full, this is also restricted to
those observations above the elevation mask.
If the multipath option was set (which it is by default), the average multipath RMS is given. If a moving average window was used (which is
used by default), information about the length of this window is given. If qc-full, the multipath RMS is only for observations above the
elevation mask.
The number of detected millisecond receiver clock resets is then given. This is followed by the total drift of the receiver clock, an estimate of
the average receiver clock drift, and, if the number of clock resets is non-zero, the average time between resets in minutes.
The length of time required before an SV data gap is reported is given next. If qc-lite, a maximum time is also given.
If the detection of n-millisecond clock slips is on (+cl option), the number of epochs with n-msec clock slips is reported. This occurs when all
SVs with multipath observables must have multipath slips of the same size to within a specified tolerance (fraction of millisecond).
This is followed by the number of other n-millisecond multipath slips which do not qualify as n-millisecond clock slips. Given a non-zero
tolerance, there is a certain probability that a few multipath slips fall within the tolerance. Therefore, a second value is given in parentheses
and this is the total number of multipath slips for the time window (no elevation mask cutoff). If the tolerance is set to 1e-2 millisecond, ratios
on the order of 2:100 are expected due to chance. Significantly higher ratios are an indication of a sick receiver.
Next if doing the derivative of the L2-ionospheric observable (+iod) or multipath (+mp), counts of the number of IOD and/or multipath slips
is given. If qc-full, this is further broken down according to elevation mask. In order to qualify as a count here, both MP1 and MP2 must slip
(though not necessarily by the same amount) at the same epoch for a particular SV.
Finally, a "SUM" line in printed, showing the start and end times of the window, the length of the time window in hours, the observation
interval in seconds, the number of possible observations (if qc-full), the number of complete observations, the ratio of complete to possible
observations as a percent (if qc-full), the multipath RMS values for MP1 and MP2 (limited by the elevation mask if qc-full), and lastly the
"observations per slip".
The "observations per slip" needs a bit of explanation. First, "observations" means "complete observations" as defined above, including the
elevation mask if qc-full. Second, "slip" means "either an IOD slip and/or both MP1 and MP2 slips occurred during the epoch having a
complete observation for this SV".
Some additional information for each SV can be included in the short report segment by using the +ssv option. Similar to the main SUM line,
shown for each SV with observations are: the expected number of observations, the number of complete observations, the number of deleted
observations, ratio of complete to possible observations, multipath RMS values for MP1 and MP2, and the observations per slip.
Long Report Segment:
The long report segment contains a further breakdown of information by SV and by elevation (if qc-full). In the long report segment,
individual SVs are often referenced. The leading character indicated the satellite system:
G: NAVSTAR GPS system
R: GLONASS system
T: NNSS Transit syste
The first portion is a list of some of the processing parameters, followed by a time stamp of the first and last observation epochs within the
time window, and the observation interval.
Next is a breakdown of observations per SV. If doing qc-full and the SV had ephemeris data, the values in the first four columns have
meaning:
#+hor: 
number of observations above the horizon for this SV
<ele>:
mean elevation of SV above the horizon for epochs with observations
#+mask:
number of observations above the elevation mask for this SV
<ele>:
mean elevation of SV above the elevation mask for epochs with observations
Next are the number of reported and complete observations. If doing qc-full and the SV had ephemeris data, the values are for epochs only
above the elevation mask; otherwise, the values are for all epochs:
#reprt:
number of observations with any data reported for this SV
#compl:
number of "complete" observations reported for this SV (see definition in "Short Report Segment")
Next are the number of L1, L2, P1, P2, and C/A observations. Again, if doing qc-full and the SV had ephemeris data, the values are for
epochs only above the elevation mask; otherwise, the values are for all epochs:
L1:
number of L1 observations for this SV
L2:
number of L2 observations for this SV
P1:
number of P1 observations for this SV
P2:
number of P2 observations for this SV
CA:
number of C/A observations for this SV
If doing qc-full, any SV computed to be above the elevation mask but not having any data reported is listed next.
If doing qc-full, any SV not having ephemeris data but having observation data of any kind is identified with a "*". 
Next, a summary tally is given. If doing qc-full and a site position was found, the total number of observation below the elevation mask is
given (i.e., number of observations excluded because of low elevation). Next, reasons for incomplete observations (above the elevation mask
if a site position was found) are summarized: missing L1, L2, P1 or C/A, or P2, or poor S/N for L1 or L2.
Following this is the number of observations reported with any code or phase data. (Note: If an SV has only, say, Doppler data, it will not be
reported here.) This is followed by the number of observation deleted for any reason: below elevation mask (if qc-full), missing code or phase
data, and/or poor S/N. Finally, the number of complete observation is given.
Next, repeat of the receiver clock offset and drift statistics is given.
"Strange" Behavior
Section 22.
If doing qc full mode (i.e., NAV file(s) supplied either implicitly or explicitly or using binary target files) the qc full>>>>>>>...
indicator may, on some file data sets, pause part way through and then appear to keep going. Don’t panic. Everything is operating
normally. Here’s what is happening:
The qc full mode really starts off in a qc lite mode. When using target files (as opposed to stdin), teqc has the luxury of being able to go
to any arbitrary location in a file. The first primary goal of the a qc full run is to find the pseudorange point position of the antenna. A
certain minimal amount of information is required before this is possible. There must be a certain number of SVs reporting pseudorange
data for a given epoch and teqc must have ephemeris information for those SVs. Occasionally, this does not happen early in the file.
When it does happen, teqc starts re-reading and re-processing the target file now knowing the antenna position. If plot files have been
requested, this is when they are written. The pause you are seeing is the time it takes teqc to go back and re-do all these items and get
back up to the epoch when the point position was determined.
If doing qc full mode (i.e., NAV file(s) supplied either implicitly or explicitly or using binary target files) and the plot option is turned
on, but no position was found (for whatever reason), no plot files are created. This is a consequence of the logic used for the qc full
mode (see above item).
Direct qc of binary files produces a slightly different result than qc of RINEX files. This is due to the direct qc of binaries being
designed for direct data streams from receivers, and thus lacking the capability of treating the data stream as a file. Also for direct qc,
the plot file information regarding the elevation and azimuth of each SV will begin at the first epoch where both the antenna position
and an SV ephemeris are both known, whereas for qc of RINEX files, the elevation and azimuth information will be computed for the
entire window of interest. This behavior can usually be correctly by pre-loading a RINEX NAV file, say, from the same site and the
previous day, using the -nav option.
If doing any qc mode, the user intends to input NAV file(s), but uses +nav filename instead of -nav filename, the original file filename
may be re-opened and destroyed. One safeguard has been implemented to help prevent this when the qc command is ordered:
teqc [options] +qc [options] +nav filename [rest_of_command]
in other words, turning on the qc option before specifying the RINEX NAV filename, and the command does not involve a translation
from binary. In this case, the program will not allow the filename to be re-opened in a "write" mode, which if it took place would
destroy the original file.
When using the Borland DOS shell version of teqc, ASCII lines written to files by teqc terminate with a newline (’\n’ = CTRL J =
0x0a). ASCII lines spewed to stdout and then redirected to a file will be terminated with a carriage return (’\r’ = CTRL M = 0x0d) and
then the newline. This added carriage return is apparently being done by the DOS shell.
The WatCom DOS shell version of teqc results in the extra carriage returns being added in both cases, both as files written by teqc and
stdout redirected to a file.
As usual, if you ftp the DOS-created files to UNIX in ASCII mode, the added carriage returns are removed; if you ftp the same files to
UNIX in binary mode, the added carriage returns are left in the files.
